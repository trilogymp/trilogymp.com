## Setting up the project

## Publishing the page

To publish a new page build, simply push changes to the `production` branch and
the Cloudflare Pages GitHub integration will take care of the rest.

Pushing to other branches, including the `main` branch, will result in a preview
build. A public preview link will be available on Cloudflare Pages dashboard.

Use `npm run wrangler` to see all available commands.
