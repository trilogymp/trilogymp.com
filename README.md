## Setting up the project

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`

## Developing

1. Run `npm run dev`

## Publishing the page

To publish a new build, simply push changes to the `production` branch and the
Cloudflare Pages GitHub integration will take care of the rest.

Pushing to other branches, including the `main` branch, will result in a preview
build. A public preview link will be available on Cloudflare Pages dashboard.

## Publishing the worker

To publish a new worker build, use the
[Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler). First
log in to your authorized Cloudflare account using `npm run wrangler login` and
then use `npm run workers:publish` to publish the worker in all environments.
Use `npm run wrangler` to see all available commands.

## Exporting a static version

You can export a static version with `npm run export`. The resulting files will
be located in the default `out` directory.
